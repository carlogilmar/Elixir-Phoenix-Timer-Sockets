# Timerapp

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

# Notes

> We will be using a GenServer for our timer since they are amazing and everybody needs to know how to use them. Short and sweet: a GenServer is an Elixir process that maintains state and executes code.

##### Ejecutar en lÃ­nea de comando para ver el timer

> Timerapp.Timer.start_link()
